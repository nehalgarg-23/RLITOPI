##  About the Project

This project proposes an automated irrigation system that:

- 📊 Uses **XGBoost** for predictive scheduling based on moisture, weather, and crop data.
- 🗺️ Applies **image segmentation** to form irrigation zones using drone-captured images.
- 🤖 Utilizes **Reinforcement Learning (PPO & Q-learning)** for dynamic and efficient water path optimization.
